# Data Visualization Capstone Project

Welcome to the Data Visualization Capstone Project repository!

This project is the culmination of the "Data Visualization with Python" course. It aims to demonstrate your skills in data visualization and analysis. In this capstone project, you have utilized Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium, to create informative and visually appealing plots and charts to communicate insights from the dataset.

## Project Objectives

- Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Apply visualization techniques to communicate insights from the data.
- Analyze data through visualizations.
- Customize visualizations for effective storytelling.

## Project Details

### Scenario

The project involves creating plots to answer questions and analyze "historical_automobile_sales" data. The primary objective is to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. The specific recession periods under analysis include:

- Recession Period 1: Year 1980
- Recession Period 2: Year 1981 to 1982
- Recession Period 3: Year 1991
- Recession Period 4: Year 2000 to 2001
- Recession Period 5: Year-end 2007 to mid-2009
- Recession Period 6: Year 2020 - Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

### Data Description

The dataset used for this capstone project contains "historical_automobile_sales" data, which includes the following variables:

1. Date: The date of the observation.
2. Recession: A binary variable indicating recession periods.
3. Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
4. GDP: Per capita GDP value in USD.
5. Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
6. Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence.
7. Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales.
8. Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
9. Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
10. Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold, including Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, and Sports.
11. Competition: A measure of competition in the market.

By examining various factors from the dataset, the project aims to gain insights into how recessions have impacted automobile sales.
